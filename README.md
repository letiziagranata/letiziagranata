<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I'm passionate developer with a unique journey through diverse fields of study. I graduated from a scientific high school with a love for physics and mathematics, which initially led me to computer engineering. However, the pandemic inspired a shift to English and German linguistics.<br><br>Despite changing my academic path, my interest in technology remained strong, leading me to explore computational linguistics and complete a thesis on the machine processing of linguistic data. This blend of linguistics and technology has fueled my passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>My journey continued at the Apple Developer Academy and has followed in the second year of the Academy, attending the Pier Program, where I honed my skills in Swift programming and teamwork. My humanistic background has equipped me with a flexible mindset and adaptability, which I further developed during my Erasmus in Germany.<br><br>Currently, I'm excited about integrating my interdisciplinary expertise into innovative tech solutions. I am eager to apply my skills to contribute to technological solutions and make a positive impact in the field of technology.</p>
